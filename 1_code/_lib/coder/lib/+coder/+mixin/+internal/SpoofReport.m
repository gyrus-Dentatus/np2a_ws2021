% Inheriting from this mixing does not change class behavior
% in any way, but changes the way MATLAB Coder compilation report
% shows instances of the class.
%
% Specifically, the size and complexity of a variable of this 
% class will be displayed based on the size and complexity
% of the first non-static property that the class has.
%
% Note that the class of the property is not used. Only size and complexity.
