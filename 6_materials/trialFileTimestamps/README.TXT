This filter contains scripts to extract timestamps of when trial-data-files were last edited as well as a .mat files with extracted timestamps.

CAREFUL:
Data files in cloud have wrong timestamps, which correspond to the data they were downloaded. To get the actual timestamps, one has to get the original data from the lab.
