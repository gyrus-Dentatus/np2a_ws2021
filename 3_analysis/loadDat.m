function [gazeTrace, hasDataloss] = loadDat(thisSubject, thisCondition, thisTrial, pathData)

    % Loads a subject's gaze trace from the corresponding dat file.
    %
    % Input
    % thisSubject: integer; ID of this subject
    % thisCondition: integer; ID of this condition
    % thisTrial: integer; number of current trial
    % pathData: string; path to folder with data
    %
    % Output
    % gazeTrace: matrix; timestamps of gaze samples, x and y gaze 
    % coordinates, and event flags.
    % hasDataloss: boolean; gaze trace is missing samples?
    %
    % NOTE
    % the exact format of gaze traces might differ, depending on which
    % playback routine was used to store them, and wheter one eye or both
    % eyes were recorded. THIS FUNCTION DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR DIFFERENT FILE
    % FORMATS!
