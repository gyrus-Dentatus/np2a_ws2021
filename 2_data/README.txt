Data from new pilot sample, for which we extended the # of demo trials they do.
Subject 1 (C.) was completely naive and never saw the paradigm before; however, she produced a lot of fixation errors, most likely due to the eye tracker calibration being bad at such extreme display locations (was not a problem for the previous pilot sample). Fixation tolerance was increased from 1.5 to 2 and fixation color was changed to black, in the hope this would solve the fixation problem.

Subjects 97, 98 99 are some HiWis of ours (J., E., and A.), which did single-target with the new projector. Just measured them to check if the performance with the new projector is comparable to the performance of people with the old projector.

Experiment 4&5 are data from the manual reaching experiments, after Jan processed his data so it is compatible with my analysis pipeline
