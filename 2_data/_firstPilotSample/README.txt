e2v99 & e3v99 are datasets from J. Data was recorded with old settings, i.e.,
stimuli are still shown around a central fixation cross. However, this version
of the experiment already had masks as the default stimuli, which were only
uncovered upon fixation.

Datasets 1 (C.), 3 (S.), 6 (E.) and 7 (A.) are from our HiWis and where recorded with the new stimulus arrangement. However, subjects 1 & 3 had glasses, so the paradigm might not have worked properly for them.

Datasets 2 (E.) and 8 (C.) are from Schub√∂ HiWis. However, subject 2 wore glasses and subject 8 did attend the NP seminar in the semester where the pilot was done

Dataset 9 (E.) was from a completely naive subject.
